Enhancement: Use Tusd data storage implementations

Decomposedfs now uses the data store implementation for uploads that comes with tusd instead of implementing the interface itself. This allows storing uploads directly in s3. When all bytes are transferred tusd will call `PreFinishResponseCallback` if the storage driver implements it.
