# layout for the users home?
# no, use GetHome?
# for eos we need to rewrite the path

# use webdav_namespace = "/home" to use the old namespace that only exposes the users files
# this endpoint should not affect the desktop client sync but will present different folders for the other clients:
# - the desktop clients use a hardcoded remote.php/dav/files/<username> if the dav.chunkung capability is present
# - the ios ios uses the core.webdav-root capability which points to remote.php/webdav in oc10
# - the oc js sdk is hardcoded to the remote.php/webdav so it will see the new tree
# - TODO android? no sync ... but will see different tree
